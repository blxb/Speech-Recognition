# Speech-Recognition
a python script that records your voice and translates it to an chosen language that you choose.

# How to use it
Open visual studio code, open file *main.py* and click run
if you wonder how it all works then read all of my comments I left in that script

Right now Script requires a internet connection because google translate is an online translator that only work within internet source.
But on the internet you can find other solutions how to use translator that works even offline

# IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH RUNNING THE SCRIPT DON'T ASK ME FOR HELP. USE CHATGPT, YOUTUBE VIDEOS, PYTHON DOCUMENTATIONS OR OTHER SOURCES THAT COULD HELP YOU..
